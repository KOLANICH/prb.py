**We have moved to https://codeberg.org/KFmts/prb.py (the namespace has changed to `KFmts`, which groups packages related to parsing or serialization), grab new versions there.**

Under the disguise of "better security" Micro$oft-owned GitHub has [discriminated users of 1FA passwords](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) while having commercial interest in success and wide adoption of [FIDO 1FA specifications](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download/) and [Windows Hello implementation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422) which [it promotes as a replacement for passwords](https://github.blog/2023-07-12-introducing-passwordless-authentication-on-github-com/). It will result in dire consequencies and is competely inacceptable, [read why](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

If you don't want to participate in harming yourself, it is recommended to follow the lead and migrate somewhere away of GitHub and Micro$oft. Here is [the list of alternatives and rationales to do it](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/49869). If they delete the discussion, there are certain well-known places where you can get a copy of it. [Read why you should also leave GitHub](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

A parser for `*.prb` files, that are used by "Delphi for Fun" [Logic Problem Solver](http://delphiforfun.org/Programs/logic_problem_solver.htm) by Gary Darby. The archives with the tool contain quite some pre-formalized examples, that may be used in future to test this library.
